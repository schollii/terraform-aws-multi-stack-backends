This terraform module facilitates the management of terraform state remote 
backends: 

- One bucket for any number of terraform state.
- Support for the notion of "stack", consisting of multiple building blocks
  in the form of terraform root modules. Eg a terraform state for a root 
  module focussed on a stack's network resources, another state for a root
  module focussed on a stack's databases, another for a stack's EKS cluster,
  etc.
- Automatic generation of the `backend.tf` of each root module of each 
  stack, thus eliminating the chicken-and-egg dance that is otherwise 
  required to provision a new stack.
- Support for storing this module's state in s3 in same bucket (via 
  `this_tfstate_in_s3` variable).
- Generate policies that can be used to control access to the backends 
  manager, to all modules of specific stacks, or to each stack module 
  individually.
  
The list of stacks to manage is a tree: 

stack ID -> module ID -> information about the stack (currently just 
the path). 

Example: 
```hcl
# your main.tf for the tfstate manager
module "tfstate_manager" {
  source  = "schollii/multi-stack-backends/aws"

  stacks_map = {
    stack-1 = {
      network = {
        path = "../stack1-network"
      }
      cluster = {
        path = "../stack1-cluster"
      }
    },
    stack-2 = {
      network = {
        path = "../stack2-network"
      }
      cluster = {
        path = "../stack2-cluster"
      }
    },
  }
}
```

including diagrams that illustrate the different pieces managed by this 
module.
